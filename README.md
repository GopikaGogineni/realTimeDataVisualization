# realTimeDataVisualization
The main idea of this project is to develop a responsive Bootstrap website which will be displaying multiple charts and tables based upon the selection made by the user. The data that is required for generating the graphs will be stored in the MySQL database. The graphs are generated using highcharts and the tables are generated using jQuery datatables. Apart from the data visualization, we can also send automated alert emails to the employees whose mailbox size exceeds a particular limit. I have used XAMPP in order to run this code.
